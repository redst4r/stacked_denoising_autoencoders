# stacked_denoising_autoencoders

Trying the reproduce the results from (http://jmlr.org/papers/volume11/vincent10a/vincent10a.pdf)
    
    Stacked Denoising Autoencoders: Learning Useful Representations in a Deep Network with a Local Denoising Criterion
*Requirements*:
- lasagne
- nolearn

The big issue for me is that I am not able to reproduce the filters the authors obtain: 
- They get blob/edge detectors
- I get some random crap
